# Git Rules

- Always add "[AI Agent]" at the front of the commit message when making a commit
- Keep the entire commit message as a single message, not separated into multiple messages
- Use a short summary line followed by a blank line and then bullet points for details if needed
- Always update the changelog file before making any commit; if there is no changelog file, create one
- Always include the date and time in the changelog and use tags at the front of each item, e.g.: [Add], [Update], [Remove]
- Always update the changelog tags definition section when creating a new tag with its explanation
- Ensure the commit message reflects all the changes documented in the changelog
